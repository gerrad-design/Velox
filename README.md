# ðŸš— Velox  (Frontend)

Velox is a lightweight, reliable ride-hailing platform built to serve
commuters in smaller cities and underserved regions. This repository
contains the **React frontend** of the Velox project.


## Problem

Urban commuters often face inconsistent, expensive, or unreliable ride
options. Many existing ride-hailing solutions fail to cater to smaller
 cities or lack lightweight, accessible platforms for drivers and riders.


##  Solution

Velox delivers a **fast, user-friendly ride-hailing app** that efficiently
connects users with local drivers. The platform focuses on simplicity,
essential features, and accessibility to offer an affordable and reliable
 transport experience.



##  Technologies used

- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ For responsive and modern UI styling
- **Fetch API** â€“ To integrate with the Flask backend
- **JWT** â€“ For handling user authentication (via backend)
- **vercel** - For deployment



## MVP Features (Frontend Scope)

-  Authentication UI (login, register) integrated with backend JWT auth
-  Three main routes ( Home, Rider, Driver dashboards)
-  Request ride & drive features for users and drivers
